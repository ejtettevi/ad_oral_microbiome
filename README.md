## ðŸ“Š Overview
We present an integrated analysis of the oral microbiome in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) patients and age-matched controls using 16S rRNA sequencing data.  
Our workflow combines **taxonomic profiling**, **ecological diversity metrics**, **functional inference**, and **machine learning** to reveal microbial dysbiosis associated with AD.

### Key Findings
- **20% expansion** of *Proteobacteria* and **61% depletion** of *Actinobacteriota* in AD.
- **Increased alpha diversity** in AD cases (*Chao1 p = 0.003; Fisher p = 0.009*).
- **Coordinated metabolic reprogramming**, including upregulation of:
  - Peptidoglycan maturation  
  - Thiamine biosynthesis  
  - Phospholipid metabolism
- **Random Forest classifier (AUC = 0.85)** demonstrated strong diagnostic potential.
